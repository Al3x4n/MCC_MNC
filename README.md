Scrap available information on the Internet related to:
- Mobile Network Operators (such as MCC, MNC, brand, network type, countries of operation...)
- countries (such as country name, 2 and 3-chars ISO codes, sovereignity, tld...)
- international dialplan (such as msisdn prefix and associated countries)
And generate JSON and Python dictionnaries from them.

###Â Which one to use

After checking several sources, it seems Wikipedia has the must complete, up-to-date and accurate information.
Therefore, the tool primarily uses it to build the JSON / Python dictionnaries.
