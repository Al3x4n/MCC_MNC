Communication of 12.VI.2018
                                       Telephone numbering plan
The Basic Technical Numbering Plan (“Numbering Plan”) was published in the Official Gazette of the
Federation on 21 June 1996. It lays the foundation for proper administration and use of national
numbering in that it allocates the available resources efficiently, fairly, equitably and in a non-
discriminatory fashion. Its adoption enabled the country to increase its numbering resources, re-
organize existing allocations, harmonize the criteria for allocating long-distance codes and comply with
the relevant international recommendations.
On 12 November 2014, the Official Gazette of the Federation published the Agreement of the Plenum
of the Federal Institute of Telecommunications issuing number portability rules and modifying the
Basic Technical Numbering Plan, the Basic Technical Signalling Plan and the operational requirements
for the introduction of geographic and non-geographic number portability.
On 11 May 2018, the Official Gazette of the Federation published the Agreement of the Plenum of
the Federal Institute of Telecommunications approving and issuing the Basic Technical Numbering
Plan, the Basic Technical Signalling Plan and modification of the number portability rules published
on 12 November 2014. These new plans will enter into force on 3 August 2019.
In particular, the new Numbering Plan envisages replacing the concepts of local and geographic
numbers with that of national numbers; eliminates the concept of regional codes to delimit geographic
areas for the purposes of number assignment and use, adopting in their stead a geographic division of
8 (eight) areas; establishes the need to accredit 85 per cent (eighty five per cent) usage of numbers
previously assigned to a specific mode of use and inside one area in order to allocate additional
numbering resources to telecommunication service providers (“Providers”).
Additionally, it establishes electronic procedures for the handling and management of procedures
related to numbering resources and clear, detailed and concise assessment criteria for their sources;
eliminates long-distance originating operator identification codes (ABC) and maintains the
assignments of long-distance destination operator identification codes (BCD) — however, these will
be used as identification codes for the local originating and destination network (IDO/IDD); requires
all fixed and/or mobile service providers to have an administrative identification code (IDA); and
incorporates the mobile network code (MNC) assignment procedure.
The new Numbering Plan also requires the submission of bimonthly disaggregated reports on the use
of national numbers/non-geographic numbers assigned directly and monthly disaggregated reports on
the use of numbers provided by other licensees; it establishes a procedure for the return of numbering
resources where the use of one or more national number blocks is not required, their use is not
initiated within the set period, a usage of less than 51 per cent (fifty one per cent) is reported for six
successive two-month periods, in cases of public interest or national security, as well as pursuant to
any legal provision, administrative decision or regulation issued for that purpose.
Furthermore, it establishes a uniform 10-digit dialling procedure for the entire national territory,
whether for fixed-line or mobile calls; eliminates the prefixes: 01, 02, 044 and 045; eliminates the prefix
1 in dialling procedures for incoming international calls to mobile numbers in the “calling party pays”
mode; and eliminates groups of special service codes and the selection by prior subscription service.




Areas
For the purposes of number assignment and administration, the national territory is divided into eight
areas. Thus, all national numbers beginning with the same digit belong to the same area.
The areas are as follows:

                        Area                                         Area number
                         East                                              2
                        West                                               3
                        North                                              4
                       Central                                             5
                   North-West                                              6
                   South-West                                              7
                      North-East                                           8
                      South-East                                           9
With the division of the national territory into areas, for the purposes of number assignment and
administration, resources currently allocated to Providers, and those to be assigned, may be used in
any population centre that the Provider considers appropriate, bound only by the geographic limits of
the area.

Special service codes
Structure of special service codes
Special services may be provided by Providers or government entities.
Special service codes use the following structure:

                                       Special service codes (3 digits)
                                                      0NX
Where:
N= generic for special service provided = 1, 2, 3, …,9
X= 0, 1, …,9
Any numbering sequence of two or more digits other than those already established or the sequence
used as prefix for access to the long-distance international service (00) may be used by Providers as
long as they do not clash with the national and non-geographic numbering assigned by the Institute.
For the services they provide their users directly or via third parties, Providers may use “#”, “*” and
other non-numeric characters, except for the structures “*0NX” and “#0NX”, which are reserved.
Under no circumstances should the sequence “911” be used, or any other sequence which might cause
confusion with the national emergency services number, 911, such as *911, #911, etc.
Dialling procedures
The dialling procedures for calls to special service codes are as follows:


                                            Special service codes
                                                     3 digits


Established special service codes
The established special service codes are as follows:

The single number used throughout the country for emergency services comprises three digits and
takes the following form: 911 (nine, one, one).
Special service codes should be available for dialling from any national line. To that end, all Providers
must follow up the changes in the corresponding routing matrices and update their systems
accordingly in order to ensure access and correct routing for calls made to the special service
numbers.
Providers must provide free and unrestricted access to the following services, including for, but not
limited to, telephones of users without credit or with restricted service and public telephones: receipt
and processing of complaints (050), generation of PINs (051), federal public security services (088),
whistle-blowing service (089), single emergency service number (911).



Dialling procedure for international long-distance services
Access prefix for international long-distance service
The access prefix for the international long-distance service to be used by all Providers is as follows:
                    Prefix                                           Purpose
                     00              Automatic international long-distance call

Dialling procedures for outgoing international calls
The dialling procedures for calls to international users’ numbers and non-geographic numbers of
other countries are as follows:

                                      International long-distance calls
                                         00 + International number


                              Calls to international non-geographic numbers
                                 00 + International non-geographic number
The international non-geographic number includes the country code. International non-geographic
number services may be restricted by international agreements between operators.


Telecommunication service provider identification codes
Providers must have the necessary identification codes for performing billing, call routing and
portability functions. To that end, the Institute shall assign to each Provider the identification code
required for its activities, except for the code 000, which will be held in reserve.


Originating network identification code (IDO)
Public telecommunication networks originating traffic must have an IDO code so that there is
sufficient information in the signalling exchanged regarding to whom the traffic’s interconnection
charges should be billed.
The IDO code comprises 3 digits and takes the following form:

                                  Originating network identification code
                                                IDO (3 digits)


Where:
I = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
D = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
O = 0, 1, 2, …, 9




Destination network identification code (IDD)
Public telecommunication networks carrying out traffic termination activities must have an IDD code
so that there is sufficient information in the signalling exchanged for the user’s destination network to
be identified in order to ensure delivery.
The IDD code comprises 3 digits and takes the following form:

                                  Destination network identification code
                                                IDD (3 digits)
Where:
I = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
D = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
D = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
Administrative identification code (IDA)
Companies must have an IDA code in order to be identified as a Provider with numbering assigned by
the Institute or provided by another licensee and used under any commercial agreement.
The IDA code comprises 3 digits and takes the following form:


                                     Administrative identification code
                                                IDA (3 digits)

Where:
I = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
D = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
A = 0, 1, 2, …, 9
No IDA code used by a company may be the same as an IDO/IDD code assigned to a licensee.
Mobile network codes
IMSI structure
The International Mobile Subscription Identity (IMSI) serves to identify a single subscription. It
comprises 15 digits, grouped into three fields, and takes the following form.

                                                                                 Mobile Subscription
        Mobile Country Code                Mobile Network Code
                                                                                Identification Number
                    (MCC)                          (MNC)
                                                                                        (MSIN)
                3 digits                           3 digits
                                                                                        9 digits
|___________________________________MSI__________________________________________|




Where:
The MCC is the first three digits of the IMSI and represents the mobile country code. The MCC
assigned to Mexico by ITU is 334.
The MNC is the next three digits of the IMSI and represents the mobile network code. It is
administered by the Institute and assigned to mobile service providers.
The MSIN makes up the last nine digits of the IMSI and represents the mobile subscription
identification number. The MSIN is administered directly by the mobile providers that have an MNC
assigned by the Institute.
Providers requiring IMSI resources must apply to the Institute for the assignment of an MNC allowing
them to clearly identify the mobile network in such a way that they can administer the MSINs of the
entire IMSI block.
